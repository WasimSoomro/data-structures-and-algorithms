There is a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

Then there is a binary tree class, with a pre-order method, in order method, and post order method.

There is a binary search tree class, with an add method and contain method.


## Tree-Max

### Find Maximum Value

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I used a recursive approach through the tree. O(n) is the time complexity where n is the number of nodes in the tree. O(h) is the space complexity where h is the height of the tree.
